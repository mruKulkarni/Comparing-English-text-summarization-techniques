of Syracuse. Syracusians are not allowed in Ephesus, so Egeon has been detained. When asked why he is now in Ephesus, Egeon explains how he is searching for his lost twin sons and their twin servants.\n","\n","Twenty three years before, Egeon had lost his wife and one of their identical twin sons (along with the boy's slave) in a storm at sea. Egeon had brought up the surviving boy and his slave. At eighteen, they had gone in search of their lost brothers. After no word from them, Egeon had also left home to seek news in Ephesus. Solinus is softened by the story and allows Egeon until sunset to try to raise 1,000 marks as a ransom or else he must die.\n","Meanwhile, in a nearby marketplace, a merchant has befriended two tourists: Antipholus of Syracuse (Egeon's son) and his servant companion, Dromio. Learning of the ban on Syracusians, they put on local dress before going to explore the town. Unknown to them, their twin brothers (with identical names) have been living there after being saved from the storm by fishermen.\n","Antipholus of Syracuse is very surprised to be accosted by Dromio of Ephesus. Dromio is angry that his master has not returned home to his wife, Adriana, for dinner. The likeness of the Dromio twins, and also the sons of Egeon, leads to a series of confusions. This is especially true when Antipholus of Syracuse dines with his sister-in-law and falls in love with her sister, Luciana. His servant, Dromio of Syracuse, refuses to open the door to anyone. He bars the door even when Antipholus of Ephesus returns home with his merchant friends. This exclusion enrages Antipholus of Ephesus and leads him to dine with his friend, the courtesan\n","A gold chain that Antipholus of Ephesus has ordered is delivered to Antipholus of Syracuse instead. The goldsmith’s claim for payment leads to the arrest of Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant. They refuse to pay for a chain that they did not receive. Adriana, fearing for her husband's sanity, gets the schoolmaster to exorcise him and Dromio (both of Ephesus). While they are under restraint, their Syracusian brothers cause panic in the town. The people think that the Ephesian brothers have somehow escaped. The Syracusian brothers, also frightened, take refuge in a priory or abbey.\n","The sunset hour of Egeon's sentence is soon approaching. The Duke returns, but is stopped by Adriana, who appeals for aid for her husband. The Ephesian twins escape their bonds and arrive to claim justice. Egeon recognises them, or so he thinks, as the boys he brought up in Syracuse. Solinus, the Duke, sends for the Abbess, who appears with the second pair of twins. She further amazes everyone by recognising Egeon and revealing herself as Emilia, his long-lost wife. She had entered a religious order after surviving the storm and fearing that all her family had died.\n","When all have told their stories, Antipholus of Syracuse renews his attempts to woo his sister-in-law, Luciana. The Duke pardons Egeon, and everyone goes to celebrate with Emilia at the temple. The two Dromios joyfully leave the stage hand in hand.\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"M64PO2aC7t2B"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["EVALUATE METRICS"],"metadata":{"id":"yMLieuoxVD3K"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["FIND METRICS"],"metadata":{"id":"YULiwR_DVJiH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<b>COMEDY OF ERRORS</b> METRICS"],"metadata":{"id":"t5LlZdPfjnlq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1\n","#User query\n","generated_summary=\"\"\"thou hast stolen both mine office and my name:\n","\tThe one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.\n","Your cake here is warm within;

My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,\n","\tMade daily motions for our home return:\n","\tUnwilling I agreed; alas! I from my mistress come to you in post;\n","\tIf I return, I shall be post indeed,\n","\tFor she will score your fault upon my pate. Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock\n","\tAnd strike you home without a messenger. I have some marks of yours upon my pate,\n","\tSome of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,\n","\tBut not a thousand marks between you both. Upon my life, by some device or other\n","\tThe villain is o'er-raught of all my money. no marvel though she pause;\n","\tThey can be meek that have no other cause. Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning? When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,\n","\tHe ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:\n","\t''Tis dinner time,' quoth I; 'my gold!' quoth he:\n","\t'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?' Hath homely age the alluring beauty took\n","\tFrom my poor cheek? Wast thou mad,\n","\n","\tThat thus so madly thou didst answer me? Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing. No, sir: I think the meat wants that I have\n","\n","\n","\n","\tIn good time, sir; what's that? There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature. Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts: and what he hath scanted men in hair, he hath given them in wit. Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair. The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers. how comes it,\n","\tThat thou art thus estranged from thyself? Thyself I call it, being strange to me,\n","\tThat, undividable, incorporate,\n","\tAm better than thy dear self's better part. Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot! Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,\n","\tSay he dines forth, and let no creature enter. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords. And welcome more common, for that's nothing but words. The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either. They stand at the door, master: bid them welcome hither. Against my soul's pure truth why labour you\n","\tTo make it wander in an unknown field? I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself. Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept: for why she sweats; a man may go over shoes in the grime of it. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it. Marry, sir, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs. In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war against her heir. Go home with it and please your wife withal;\n","\tAnd soon at supper-time I'll visit you,\n","\tAnd then receive my money for the chain. I see, a man here needs not live by shifts,\n","\tWhen in the streets he meets such golden gifts. Saving your merry humour, here's the note\n","\tHow much your chain weighs to the utmost carat. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have,\n","\tOr else you may return without your money. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:\n","\tConsider how it stands upon my credit. I would not spare my brother in this case,\n","\tIf he should scorn me so apparently. Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;\n","\tAnd told thee to what purpose, and what end. Thither I must, although against my will,\n","\tFor servants must their masters' minds fulfil. but I think him better than I say,\n","\tAnd yet would herein others' eyes were worse. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;\n","\tBut he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell. This I wonder at:\n","\tThat he, unknown to me, should be in debt:\n","\tTell me, was he arrested on a band? Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say,\n","\tThat Time comes stealing on by night and day? have you got the picture of old Adam new apparelled? A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,\n","\tAnd for the same he promis'd me a chain:\n","\tBoth one and other he denies me now. Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass. I am an ass indeed; you may prove it by my long ears. Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;\n","\tEstablish him in his true sense again,\n","\tAnd I will please you what you will demand. Thou gaoler, thou,\n","\tI am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them\n","\tTo make a rescue? I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:\n","\tBear me forthwith unto his creditor,\n","\tAnd, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it. Good Master doctor, see him safe convey'd\n","\tHome to my house. Hath not else his eye\n","\tStray'd his affection in unlawful love? She never reprehended him but mildly\n","\tWhen he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly. Beyond imagination is the wrong\n","\tThat she this day hath shameless thrown on me. So befall my soul\n","\tAs this is false he burdens me withal! Within this hour I was his bondman, sir;\n","\tBut he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:\n","\tNow am I Dromio and his man, unbound. But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,\n","\tThou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,\n","\tThou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,\n","\tDuke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,\n","\tBy Dromio; but I think he brought it not. Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail\n","\tOf you, my sons; and, till this present hour\n","\tMy heavy burdens ne'er delivered. I am your master, Dromio:\n","\tCome, go with us; we'll look to that anon:\n","\tEmbrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.

A heavier task could not have been impos'd\n","\tThan I to speak my griefs unspeakable;\n","\tYet, that the world may witness that my end\n","\tWas wrought by nature, not by vile offence,\n","\tI'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave. In Syracusa was I born, and wed\n","\tUnto a woman, happy but for me,\n","\tAnd by me too, had not our hap been bad. With her I liv'd in joy: our wealth increas'd\n","\tBy prosperous voyages I often made\n","\tTo Epidamnum; till my factor's death,\n","\tAnd the great care of goods at random left,\n","\tDrew me from kind embracements of my spouse:\n","\tFrom whom my absence was not six months old,\n","\tBefore herself,—almost at fainting under\n","\tThe pleasing punishment that women bear,—\n","\tHad made provision for her following me,\n","\tAnd soon and safe arrived where I was. There had she not been long but she became\n","\tA joyful mother of two goodly sons;\n","\tAnd, which was strange, the one so like the other,\n","\tAs could not be distinguish'd but by names. That very hour, and in the self-same inn,\n","\tA meaner woman was delivered\n","\tOf such a burden, male twins, both alike. Those,—for their parents were exceeding poor,—\n","\tI bought, and brought up to attend my sons. My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,\n","\tMade daily motions for our home return:\n","\tUnwilling I agreed; alas! A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,\n","\tBefore the always-wind-obeying deep\n","\tGave any tragic instance of our harm:\n","\tBut longer did we not retain much hope;\n","\tFor what obscured light the heavens did grant\n","\tDid but convey unto our fearful minds\n","\tA doubtful warrant of immediate death;\n","\tWhich, though myself would gladly have embrac'd,\n","\tYet the incessant weepings of my wife,\n","\tWeeping before for what she saw must come,\n","\tAnd piteous plainings of the pretty babes,\n","\tThat mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,\n","\tForc'd me to seek delays for them and me. And this it was, for other means was none:\n","\tThe sailors sought for safety by our boat,\n","\tAnd left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:\n","\tMy wife, more careful for the latter-born,\n","\tHad fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,\n","\tSuch as seafaring men provide for storms;\n","\tTo him one of the other twins was bound,\n","\tWhilst I had been like heedful of the other. The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,\n","\tFixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,\n","\tFasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;\n","\tAnd floating straight, obedient to the stream,\n","\tWere carried towards Corinth, as we thought. At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,\n","\tDispers'd those vapours that offended us,\n","\tAnd, by the benefit of his wished light\n","\tThe seas wax'd calm, and we discovered\n","\tTwo ships from far making amain to us;\n","\tOf Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:\n","\tBut ere they came,—O! Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;\n","\tFor we may pity, though not pardon thee. For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,\n","\tWe were encounter'd by a mighty rock;\n","\tWhich being violently borne upon,\n","\tOur helpful ship was splitted in the midst;\n","\tSo that, in this unjust divorce of us\n","\tFortune had left to both of us alike\n","\tWhat to delight in, what to sorrow for. seeming as burdened\n","\tWith lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,\n","\tWas carried with more speed before the wind,\n","\tAnd in our sight they three were taken up\n","\tBy fishermen of Corinth, as we thought. At length, another ship had seiz'd on us;\n","\tAnd, knowing whom it was their hap to save,\n","\tGave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack'd guests;\n","\tAnd would have reft the fishers of their prey,\n","\tHad not their bark been very slow of sail;\n","\tAnd therefore homeward did they bend their course. Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,\n","\tThat by misfortune was my life prolong'd,\n","\tTo tell sad stories of my own mishaps. And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,\n","\tDo me the favour to dilate at full\n","\tWhat hath befall'n of them and thee till now. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,\n","\tAt eighteen years became inquisitive\n","\tAfter his brother; and importun'd me\n","\tThat his attendant—for his case was like,\n","\tReft of his brother, but retain'd his name—\n","\tMight bear him company in the quest of him;\n","\tWhom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,\n","\tI hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd. Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,\n","\tRoaming clean through the bounds of Asia,\n","\tAnd, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,\n","\tHopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought\n","\tOr that or any place that harbours men. But here must end the story of my life;\n","\tAnd happy were I in my timely death,\n","\tCould all my travels warrant me they live. Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,\n","\tAgainst my crown, my oath, my dignity,\n","\tWhich princes, would they, may not disannul,\n","\tMy soul should sue as advocate for thee. But though thou art adjudged to the death\n","\tAnd passed sentence may not be recall'd\n","\tBut to our honour's great disparagement,\n","\tYet will I favour thee in what I can:\n","\tTherefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day\n","\tTo seek thy life by beneficial help. Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;\n","\tBeg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,\n","\tAnd live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die. Gaoler, take him to thy custody. I will, my lord. Hopeless and helpless doth Ægeon wend,\n","\tBut to procrastinate his lifeless end. Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,\n","\tLest that your goods too soon be confiscate. This very day, a Syracusian merchant\n","\tIs apprehended for arrival here;\n","\tAnd, not being able to buy out his life,\n","\tAccording to the statute of the town\n","\tDies ere the weary sun set in the west.

Many a man would take you at your word,\n","\tAnd go indeed, having so good a mean.

Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,\n","\tAnd tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart\n","\tHome to your house, the Phœnix, sir, to dinner:\n","\tMy mistress and her sister stays for you. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me,\n","\tIn what safe place you have bestow'd my money;\n","\tOr I shall break that merry sconce of yours\n","\tThat stands on tricks when I am undispos'd. I have some marks of yours upon my pate,\n","\tSome of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,\n","\tBut not a thousand marks between you both. If I should pay your worship those again,\n","\tPerchance you will not bear them patiently. Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phœnix;\n","\tShe that doth fast till you come home to dinner,\n","\tAnd prays that you will hie you home to dinner. There, take you that, sir knave. Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels. Upon my life, by some device or other\n","\tThe villain is o'er-raught of all my money. They say this town is full of cozenage;\n","\tAs, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,\n","\tDark-working sorcerers that change the mind,\n","\tSoul-killing witches that deform the body,\n","\tDisguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,\n","\tAnd many such-like liberties of sin:\n","\tIf it prove so, I will be gone the sooner. I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:\n","\tI greatly fear my money is not safe. Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,\n","\tAnd from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner. Good sister, let us dine and never fret:\n","\tA man is master of his liberty:\n","\tTime is their master, and, when they see time,\n","\tThey'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister. Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.\n","\n","\n","\n","\tO! Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe. There's nothing situate under heaven's eye\n","\tBut hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:\n","\tThe beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,\n","\tAre their males' subjects and at their controls. Men, more divine, the masters of all these,\n","\tLords of the wide world, and wild wat'ry seas,\n","\tIndu'd with intellectual sense and souls,\n","\tOf more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,\n","\tAre masters to their females and their lords:\n","\tThen, let your will attend on their accords. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway. Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey. Till he come home again, I would forbear. A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,\n","\tWe bid be quiet when we hear it cry;\n","\tBut were we burden'd with like weight of pain,\n","\tAs much, or more we should ourselves complain:\n","\tSo thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,\n","\tWith urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me:\n","\tBut if thou live to see like right bereft. Well, I will marry one day, but to try. Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear. Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it. Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully, that I could scarce understand them. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad. I mean not cuckold-mad; but, sure, he is stark mad. When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,\n","\tHe ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:\n","\t''Tis dinner time,' quoth I; 'my gold!' quoth he:\n","\t'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'my gold!' quoth he:\n","\t'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?' 'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'my gold!' quoth he:\n","\t'My mistress, sir,' quoth I: 'hang up thy mistress! Quoth my master:\n","\t'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.' So that my errand, due unto my tongue,\n","\tI thank him, I bear home upon my shoulders;\n","\tFor, in conclusion, he did beat me there. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home. For God's sake, send some other messenger. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across. And he will bless that cross with other beating:\n","\tBetween you, I shall have a holy head. You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:\n","\tIf I last in this service, you must case me in leather. His company must do his minions grace,\n","\tWhilst I at home starve for a merry look. If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,\n","\tUnkindness blunts it more than marble hard:\n","\tDo their gay vestments his affections bait? My decayed fair\n","\tA sunny look of his would soon repair;\n","\tBut, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale\n","\tAnd feeds from home: poor I am but his stale. Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain:\n","\tWould that alone, alone he would detain,\n","\tSo he would keep fair quarter with his bed! I see, the jewel best enamelled\n","\tWill lose his beauty; and though gold bides still\n","\tThat others touch, yet often touching will\n","\tWear gold; and no man that hath a name,\n","\tBy falsehood and corruption doth it shame. Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,\n","\tI'll weep what's left away, and weeping die. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up\n","\tSafe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave\n","\tIs wander'd forth, in care to seek me out. By computation, and mine host's report,\n","\tI could not speak with Dromio since at first\n","\tI sent him from the mart. See, here he comes. How now, sir! As you love strokes, so jest with me again. Even now, even here, not half-an-hour since. I did not see you since you sent me hence,\n","\tHome to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,\n","\tAnd told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;\n","\tFor which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd. I pray you, master, tell me. Hold, take thou that, and that. Because that I familiarly sometimes\n","\tDo use you for my fool, and chat with you,\n","\tYour sauciness will jest upon my love,\n","\tAnd make a common of my serious hours. When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,\n","\tBut creep in crannies when he hides his beams. If you will jest with me, know my aspect,\n","\tAnd fashion your demeanour to my looks,\n","\tOr I will beat this method in your sconce. so you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head: an you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head and insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath a wherefore. Why, first,—for flouting me; and then, wherefore,—\n","\tFor urging it the second time to me. Well, sir, I thank you. Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing. I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. No, sir: I think the meat wants that I have\n","\n","\n","\n","\tIn good time, sir; what's that? Well, sir, then 'twill be dry. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a time for all things. I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric. Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man. Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts: and what he hath scanted men in hair, he hath given them in wit. Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit. Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet be loseth it in a kind of jollity. Nay, not sound, I pray you. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing. Certain ones, then. The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature. But your reason was not substantial, why there is not time to recover. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange, and frown:\n","\tSome other mistress hath thy sweet aspects,\n","\tI am not Adriana, nor thy wife. The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow\n","\tThat never words were music to thine ear,\n","\tThat never object pleasing in thine eye,\n","\tThat never touch well welcome to thy hand,\n","\tThat never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,\n","\tUnless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee. Thyself I call it, being strange to me,\n","\tThat, undividable, incorporate,\n","\tAm better than thy dear self's better part. do not tear away thyself from me,\n","\tFor know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall\n","\tA drop of water in the breaking gulf,\n","\tAnd take unmingled thence that drop again,\n","\tWithout addition or diminishing,\n","\tAs take from me thyself and not me too. Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,\n","\tAnd hurl the name of husband in my face,\n","\tAnd tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,\n","\tAnd from my false hand cut the wedding-ring\n","\tAnd break it with a deep-divorcing vow? I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it. I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;\n","\tMy blood is mingled with the crime of lust:\n","\tFor if we two be one and thou play false,\n","\tI do digest the poison of thy flesh,\n","\tBeing strumpeted by thy contagion. Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;\n","\tI live unstain'd, thou undishonoured. I know you not:\n","\tIn Ephesus I am but two hours old,\n","\tAs strange unto your town as to your talk;\n","\tWho, every word by all my wit being scann'd,\n","\tWant wit in all one word to understand. By thee; and this thou didst return from him,\n","\tThat he did buffet thee, and in his blows,\n","\tDenied my house for his, me for his wife. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words\n","\tDidst thou deliver to me on the mart. Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,\n","\tBut wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;\n","\tThou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,\n","\tWhose weakness, married to thy stronger state,\n","\tMakes me with thy strength to communicate:\n","\tIf aught possess thee from me, it is dross,\n","\tUsurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;\n","\tWho, all for want of pruning, with intrusion\n","\tInfect thy sap and live on thy confusion. Until I know this sure uncertainty,\n","\tI'll entertain the offer'd fallacy. We talk with goblins, owls, and elvish sprites:\n","\tIf we obey them not, this will ensue,\n","\tThey'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue. I think thou art, in mind, and so am I.\n","\n","\n","\n","\tNay, master, both in mind and in my shape. No, I am an ape. If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass. 'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be\n","\tBut I should know her as well as she knows me. Come, come; no longer will I be a fool,\n","\tTo put the finger in the eye and weep,\n","\tWhilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn. Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate. Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,\n","\tAnd shrive you of a thousand idle pranks. Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,\n","\tSay he dines forth, and let no creature enter. Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well. I'll say as they say, and persever so,\n","\tAnd in this mist at all adventures go. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate. Come, come, Antipholus; we dine too late. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;\n","\tMy wife is shrewish when I keep not hours;\n","\tSay that I linger'd with you at your shop\n","\tTo see the making of her carkanet,\n","\tAnd that to-morrow you will bring it home. But here's a villain, that would face me down\n","\tHe met me on the mart, and that I beat him,\n","\tAnd charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,\n","\tAnd that I did deny my wife and house. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;\n","\tThat you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:\n","\tIf the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink,\n","\tYour own handwriting would tell you what I think. Marry, so it doth appear\n","\tBy the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear. I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,\n","\tYou would keep from my heels and beware of an ass. You are sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God, our cheer\n","\tMay answer my good will and your good welcome here. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,\n","\tA table-full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords. And welcome more common, for that's nothing but words. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest:\n","\tBut though my cates be mean, take them in good part;\n","\tBetter cheer may you have, but not with better heart. Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,\n","\tWhen one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door. Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on's feet. Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you'll tell me wherefore. The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio. thou hast stolen both mine office and my name:\n","\tThe one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame. If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,\n","\tThou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass. Let my master in, Luce. Faith, no; he comes too late;\n","\tAnd so tell your master. If thy name be call'd Luce,—Luce, thou hast answer'd him well. And you said, no. Thou baggage, let me in. Master, knock the door hard. You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down. go, get you from the door. If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither. They stand at the door, master: bid them welcome hither. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in. You would say so, master, if your garments were thin. Break any breaking here, and I'll break your knave's pate. A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind:\n","\tAy, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind. It seems thou wantest breaking: out upon thee, hind! I pray thee, let me in. Ay, when fowls have no feathers, and fish have no fin. Well, I'll break in. For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather:\n","\tIf a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together. let it not be so;\n","\tHerein you war against your reputation,\n","\tAnd draw within the compass of suspect\n","\tThe unviolated honour of your wife. Once this,—your long experience of her wisdom,\n","\tHer sober virtue, years, and modesty,\n","\tPlead on her part some cause to you unknown;\n","\tAnd doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse\n","\tWhy at this time the doors are made against you. Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,\n","\tAnd let us to the Tiger all to dinner;\n","\tAnd about evening come yourself alone,\n","\tTo know the reason of this strange restraint. If by strong hand you offer to break in\n","\tNow in the stirring passage of the day,\n","\tA vulgar comment will be made of it,\n","\tAnd that supposed by the common rout\n","\tAgainst your yet ungalled estimation,\n","\tThat may with foul intrusion enter in\n","\tAnd dwell upon your grave when you are dead;\n","\tFor slander lives upon succession,\n","\tFor ever housed where it gets possession. You have prevail'd: I will depart in quiet,\n","\tAnd, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry. I know a wench of excellent discourse,\n","\tPretty and witty, wild and yet, too, gentle:\n","\tThere will we dine: this woman that I mean,\n","\tMy wife,—but, I protest, without desert,—\n","\tHath oftentimes upbraided me withal:\n","\tTo her will we to dinner. Get you home,\n","\tAnd fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:\n","\tBring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;\n","\tFor there's the house: that chain will I bestow,\n","\tBe it for nothing but to spite my wife,\n","\tUpon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste. Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,\n","\tI'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me. If you did wed my sister for her wealth,\n","\tThen, for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:\n","\tOr, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;\n","\tMuffle your false love with some show of blindness;\n","\tLet not my sister read it in your eye;\n","\tBe not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;\n","\tLook sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;\n","\tApparel vice like virtue's harbinger;\n","\tBear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;\n","\tTeach sin the carriage of a holy saint;\n","\tBe secret-false: what need she be acquainted? 'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,\n","\tAnd let her read it in thy looks at board:\n","\tShame hath a bastard fame, well managed;\n","\tIll deeds are doubled with an evil word. poor women, make us but believe,\n","\tBeing compact of credit, that you love us;\n","\tThough others have the arm, show us the sleeve;\n","\tWe in your motion turn, and you may move us. Then, gentle brother, get you in again;\n","\tComfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:\n","\t'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,\n","\tWhen the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife. Sweet mistress,—what your name is else, I know not,\n","\tNor by what wonder you do hit of mine,—\n","\tLess in your knowledge and your grace you show not\n","\tThan our earth's wonder; more than earth divine. Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak:\n","\tLay open to my earthy-gross conceit,\n","\tSmother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,\n","\tThe folded meaning of your words' deceit. Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield. But if that I am I, then well I know\n","\tYour weeping sister is no wife of mine,\n","\tNor to her bed no homage do I owe:\n","\tFar more, far more, to you do I decline. train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,\n","\tTo drown me in thy sister flood of tears:\n","\tSing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote:\n","\tSpread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,\n","\tAnd as a bed I'll take them and there lie;\n","\tAnd, in that glorious supposition think\n","\tHe gains by death that hath such means to die:\n","\tLet Love, being light, be drowned if she sink! Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know. For gazing on your beams; fair sun, being by. Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night. No;\n","\tIt is thyself, mine own self's better part;\n","\tMine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart;\n","\tMy food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,\n","\tMy sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim. All this my sister is, or else should be. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I aim thee. soft, sir; hold you still:\n","\tI'll fetch my sister, to get her good will. Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself. I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself. Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me. Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me. A very reverent body; aye, such a one as a man may not speak of, without he say, 'Sir-reverence.' I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage. Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench, and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter; if she lives till doomsday, she'll burn a week longer than the whole world. Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept: for why she sweats; a man may go over shoes in the grime of it. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it. Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters,—that is, an ell and three quarters,—will not measure her from hip to hip. No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her. Marry, sir, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs. In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war against her heir. I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in them: but I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it. Faith, I saw not; but I felt it hot in her breath. O, sir! upon her nose, all o'er embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose. O, sir! To conclude, this drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me; call'd me Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch. And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel,\n","\tShe had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' the wheel. Go hie thee presently post to the road:\n","\tAn if the wind blow any way from shore,\n","\tI will not harbour in this town to-night:\n","\tIf any bark put forth, come to the mart,\n","\tWhere I will walk till thou return to me. If every one knows us and we know none,\n","\t'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone. As from a bear a man would run for life,\n","\tSo fly I from her that would be my wife. There's none but witches do inhabit here,\n","\tAnd therefore 'tis high time that I were hence. She that doth call me husband, even my soul\n","\tDoth for a wife abhor; but her fair sister,\n","\tPossess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,\n","\tOf such enchanting presence and discourse,\n","\tHath almost made me traitor to myself:\n","\tBut, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,\n","\tI'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song. Ay, that's my name. I know it well, sir: lo, here is the chain. What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you. I bespoke it not\n","\n","\n","\n","\tNot once, nor twice, but twenty times you have. Go home with it and please your wife withal;\n","\tAnd soon at supper-time I'll visit you,\n","\tAnd then receive my money for the chain. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,\n","\tFor fear you ne'er see chain nor money more. You are a merry man, sir: fare you well. What I should think of this, I cannot tell:\n","\tBut this I think, there's no man is so vain\n","\tThat would refuse so fair an offer'd chain. I see, a man here needs not live by shifts,\n","\tWhen in the streets he meets such golden gifts. I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay:\n","\tIf any ship put out, then straight away. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,\n","\tAnd since I have not much importun'd you;\n","\tNor now I had not, but that I am bound\n","\tTo Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:\n","\tTherefore make present satisfaction,\n","\tOr I'll attach you by this officer. Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,\n","\tI will discharge my bond, and thank you too. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou\n","\tAnd buy a rope's end, that I will bestow\n","\tAmong my wife and her confederates,\n","\tFor locking me out of my doors by day. Get thee gone;\n","\tBuy thou a rope, and bring it home to me. Belike you thought our love would last too long,\n","\tIf it were chain'd together, and therefore came not. Saving your merry humour, here's the note\n","\tHow much your chain weighs to the utmost carat. The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,\n","\tWhich doth amount to three odd ducats more\n","\tThan I stand debted to this gentleman:\n","\tI pray you see him presently discharg'd,\n","\tFor he is bound to sea and stays but for it. I am not furnish'd with the present money;\n","\tBesides, I have some business in the town. Good signior, take the stranger to my house,\n","\tAnd with you take the chain, and bid my wife\n","\tDisburse the sum on the receipt thereof:\n","\tPerchance I will be there as soon as you. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough. Well, sir, I will. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have,\n","\tOr else you may return without your money. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:\n","\tBoth wind and tide stays for this gentleman,\n","\tAnd I, to blame, have held him here too long. I should have child you for not bringing it,\n","\tBut, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch. Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money. Come, come; you know I gave it you even now. I pray you, let me see it. Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no:\n","\tIf not, I'll leave him to the officer. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:\n","\tConsider how it stands upon my credit. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit. Either consent to pay this sum for me,\n","\tOr I attach you by this officer. Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st. Here is thy fee: arrest him, officer. I would not spare my brother in this case,\n","\tIf he should scorn me so apparently. I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit. But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear\n","\tAs all the metal in your shop will answer. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,\n","\tTo your notorious shame, I doubt it not. Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum\n","\tThat stays but till her owner comes aboard,\n","\tAnd then she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,\n","\tI have convey'd aboard, and I have bought\n","\tThe oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitæ. The ship is in her trim; the merry wind\n","\tBlows fair from land; they stay for nought at all\n","\tBut for their owner, master, and yourself. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage. Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;\n","\tAnd told thee to what purpose, and what end. You sent me for a rope's end as soon:\n","\tYou sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark. I will debate this matter at more leisure,\n","\tAnd teach your ears to list me with more heed. To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;\n","\tGive her this key, and tell her, in the desk\n","\tThat's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,\n","\tThere is a purse of ducats: let her send it. Tell her I am arrested in the street,\n","\tAnd that shall bail me. On, officer, to prison till it come. that is where we din'd,\n","\tWhere Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:\n","\tShe is too big, I hope, for me to compass. Thither I must, although against my will,\n","\tFor servants must their masters' minds fulfil. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were. First, he did praise my beauty, then my speech. Have patience, I beseech. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still:\n","\tMy tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will. He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,\n","\tIll-fac'd, worse bodied, shapeless every where:\n","\tVicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,\n","\tStigmatical in making, worse in mind. but I think him better than I say,\n","\tAnd yet would herein others' eyes were worse. Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:\n","\tMy heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse. sweet, now, make haste. No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell. A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,\n","\tOne whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;\n","\tA fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;\n","\tA wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;\n","\tA back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands\n","\tThe passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;\n","\tA hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;\n","\tOne that, before the judgment, carries poor souls to hell. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;\n","\tBut he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell. Go fetch it, sister.—\n","\n"," This I wonder at:\n","\tThat he, unknown to me, should be in debt:\n","\tTell me, was he arrested on a band? Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;\n","\tA chain, a chain. No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:\n","\tIt was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one. O yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for very fear. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's worth to season. Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say,\n","\tThat Time comes stealing on by night and day? Go, Dromio: there's the money, bear it straight,\n","\tAnd bring thy master home immediately. Come, sister; I am press'd down with conceit; Conceit, my comfort and my injury. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me,\n","\tAs if I were their well acquainted friend;\n","\tAnd every one doth call me by my name. Some tender money to me; some invite me;\n","\tSome other give me thanks for kindnesses;\n","\tSome offer me commodities to buy:\n","\tEven now a tailor call'd me in his shop\n","\tAnd show'd me silks that he had bought for me,\n","\tAnd therewithal, took measure of my body. Sure these are but imaginary wiles,\n","\tAnd Lapland sorcerers inhabit here. Master, here's the gold you sent me for. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise, but that Adam that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's skin that was killed for the Prodigal: he that came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty. why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a base-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a fob, and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God give you good rest!' Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy Delay. The fellow is distract, and so am I;\n","\tAnd here we wander in illusions:\n","\tSome blessed power deliver us from hence! Well met, well met, Master Antipholus. I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:\n","\tIs that the chain you promis'd me to-day? Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof comes that the wenches say, 'God damn me;' that's as much as to say, 'God make me a light wench.' It is written, they appear to men like angels of light: light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat, so bespeak a long spoon. Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil. Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:\n","\tI conjure thee to leave me and be gone. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,\n","\tOr, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,\n","\tAnd I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,\n","\tA rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,\n","\tA nut, a cherry-stone;\n","\tBut she, more covetous, would have a chain. Master, be wise: an if you give it her,\n","\tThe devil will shake her chain and fright us with it. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:\n","\tI hope you do not mean to cheat me so. Come, Dromio, let us go. 'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,\n","\tElse would he never so demean himself. A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,\n","\tAnd for the same he promis'd me a chain:\n","\tBoth one and other he denies me now. The reason that I gather he is mad,\n","\tBesides this present instance of his rage,\n","\tIs a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,\n","\tOf his own doors being shut against his entrance\n","\tBelike his wife, acquainted with his fits,\n","\tOn purpose shut the doors against his way. My way is now to hie home to his house,\n","\tAnd tell his wife, that, being lunatic,\n","\tHe rush'd into my house, and took perforce\n","\tMy ring away. This course I fittest choose,\n","\tFor forty ducats is too much to lose. Fear me not, man; I will not break away:\n","\tI'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,\n","\tTo warrant thee, as I am 'rested for. My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,\n","\tAnd will not lightly trust the messenger. That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,\n","\tI tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears. How now, sir! Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope. I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate. To a rope's end, sir; and to that end am I return'd. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you. Good sir, be patient. Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity. Good now, hold thy tongue. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands. I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel your blows. Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass. I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep; raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a beggar wont her brat; and, I think, when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder. Mistress, respice finem, respect your end; or rather, to prophesy like the parrot, 'Beware the rope's end.' Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;\n","\tEstablish him in his true sense again,\n","\tAnd I will please you what you will demand. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear. I charge thee, Satan, hous'd within this man,\n","\tTo yield possession to my holy prayers,\n","\tAnd to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:\n","\tI conjure thee by all the saints in heaven. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home;\n","\tWhere would you had remain'd until this time. Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home. Perdy, your doors were lock'd and you shut out. Sans fable, she herself revil'd you there. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you. In verity you did: my bones bear witness,\n","\tThat since have felt the vigour of his rage. It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,\n","\tAnd, yielding to him humours well his frenzy. I sent you money to redeem you,\n","\tBy Dromio here, who came in haste for it. heart and good will you might;\n","\tBut surely, master, not a rag of money. He came to me, and I deliver'd it. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd:\n","\tI know it by their pale and deadly looks. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth. And, gentle master, I receiv'd no gold;\n","\tBut I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out. bind him, bind him, let him not come near me. Thou gaoler, thou,\n","\tI am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them\n","\tTo make a rescue? Masters, let him go:\n","\tHe is my prisoner, and you shall not have him. Go bind this man, for he is frantic too. He is my prisoner: if I let him go,\n","\tThe debt he owes will be requir'd of me. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:\n","\tBear me forthwith unto his creditor,\n","\tAnd, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it. Good Master doctor, see him safe convey'd\n","\tHome to my house. Master, I am here enter'd in bond for you. be mad, good master; cry, 'the devil!' Sister, go you with me.—\n","\n","\n","\n","\tSay now, whose suit is he arrested at? One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him? He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not. When as your husband all in rage, to-day\n","\tCame to my house, and took away my ring,—\n","\tThe ring I saw upon his finger now,—\n","\tStraight after did I meet him with a chain. It may be so, but I did never see it. Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:\n","\tI long to know the truth hereof at large. I see, these witches are afraid of swords. Faith, stay here this night, they will surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us gold: methinks they are such a gentle nation, that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me, I could find in my heart to stay here still, and turn witch. I will not stay to-night for all the town;\n","\tTherefore away, to get our stuff aboard. I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;\n","\tBut, I protest, he had the chain of me,\n","\tThough most dishonestly he doth deny it. Of very reverend reputation, sir,\n","\tOf credit infinite, highly belov'd,\n","\tSecond to none that lives here in the city:\n","\tHis word might bear my wealth at any time. Speak softly: yonder, as I think, he walks. Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him. Signior Antipholus, I wonder much\n","\tThat you would put me to this shame and trouble;\n","\tAnd not without some scandal to yourself,\n","\tWith circumstance and oaths so to deny\n","\tThis chain which now you wear so openly:\n","\tBeside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,\n","\tYou have done wrong to this my honest friend,\n","\tWho, but for staying on our controversy,\n","\tHad hoisted sail and put to sea to-day. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:\n","\tI'll prove mine honour and mine honesty\n","\tAgainst thee presently, if thou dar'st stand. I dare, and do defy thee for a villain. Some get within him, take his sword away. Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house. Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house! This is some priory: in, or we are spoil'd. Be quiet, people. Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,\n","\tAnd bear him home for his recovery. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,\n","\tAnd much different from the man he was;\n","\tBut, till this afternoon his passion\n","\tNe'er brake into extremity of rage. A sin prevailing much in youthful men,\n","\tWho give their eyes the liberty of gazing. To none of these, except it be the last;\n","\tNamely, some love that drew him oft from home. Why, so I did. Ay, but not rough enough. Haply, in private. Ay, but not enough. It was the copy of our conference:\n","\tIn bed, he slept not for my urging it;\n","\tAt board, he fed not for my urging it;\n","\tAlone, it was the subject of my theme;\n","\tIn company I often glanced it:\n","\tStill did I tell him it was vile and bad. It seems, his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,\n","\tAnd thereof comes it that his head is light. Thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls:\n","\tSweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue\n","\tBut moody moping, and dull melancholy,\n","\tKinsman to grim and comfortless despair,\n","\tAnd at her heels a huge infectious troop\n","\tOf pale distemperatures and foes to life? In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest\n","\tTo be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:\n","\tThe consequence is then, thy jealous fits\n","\tHave scar'd thy husband from the use of wits. She never reprehended him but mildly\n","\tWhen he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly. Good people, enter, and lay hold on him. Then, let your servants bring my husband forth. Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,\n","\tAnd it shall privilege him from your hands\n","\tTill I have brought him to his wits again,\n","\tOr lose my labour in assaying it. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,\n","\tDiet his sickness, for it is my office,\n","\tAnd will have no attorney but myself;\n","\tAnd therefore let me have him home with me. Be patient; for I will not let him stir\n","\tTill I have us'd the approved means I have,\n","\tWith wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,\n","\tTo make of him a formal man again. It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,\n","\tA charitable duty of my order;\n","\tTherefore depart and leave him here with me. Be quiet, and depart: thou shalt not have him. Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet,\n","\tAnd never rise until my tears and prayers\n","\tHave won his Grace to come in person hither,\n","\tAnd take perforce my husband from the abbess. By this, I think, the dial points at five:\n","\tAnon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person\n","\tComes this way to the melancholy vale,\n","\tThe place of death and sorry execution,\n","\tBehind the ditches of the abbey here. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,\n","\tWho put unluckily into this bay\n","\tAgainst the laws and statutes of this town,\n","\tBeheaded publicly for his offence. Yet once again proclaim it publicly,\n","\tIf any friend will pay the sum for him,\n","\tHe shall not die; so much we tender him. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,\n","\tWhom I made lord of me and all I had,\n","\tAt your important letters, this ill day\n","\tA most outrageous fit of madness took him,\n","\tThat desperately he hurried through the street,—\n","\tWith him his bondman, all as mad as he,—\n","\tDoing displeasure to the citizens\n","\tBy rushing in their houses, bearing thence\n","\tRings, jewels, anything his rage did like. Once did I get him bound and sent him home,\n","\tWhilst to take order for the wrongs I went\n","\tThat here and there his fury had committed. Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,\n","\tHe broke from those that had the guard of him,\n","\tAnd with his mad attendant and himself,\n","\tEach one with ireful passion, with drawn swords\n","\tMet us again, and, madly bent on us\n","\tChas'd us away, till, raising of more aid\n","\tWe came again to bind them. Then they fled\n","\tInto this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;\n","\tAnd here the abbess shuts the gates on us,\n","\tAnd will not suffer us to fetch him out,\n","\tNor send him forth that we may bear him hence. Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command\n","\tLet him be brought forth, and borne hence for help. Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars,\n","\tAnd I to thee engag'd a prince's word,\n","\tWhen thou didst make him master of thy bed,\n","\tTo do him all the grace and good I could. Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate\n","\tAnd bid the lady abbess come to me. My master and his man are both broke loose,\n","\tBeaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,\n","\tWhose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire;\n","\tAnd ever as it blaz'd they threw on him\n","\tGreat pails of puddled mire to quench the hair. My master preaches patience to him, and the while\n","\tHis man with scissors nicks him like a fool;\n","\tAnd sure, unless you send some present help,\n","\tBetween them they will kill the conjurer. thy master and his man are here,\n","\tAnd that is false thou dost report to us. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;\n","\tI have not breath'd almost, since I did see it. He cries for you and vows, if he can take you,\n","\tTo scotch your face, and to disfigure you. Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Witness you,\n","\tThat he is borne about invisible:\n","\tEven now we hous'd him in the abbey here,\n","\tAnd now he's here, past thought of human reason. grant me justice,\n","\tEven for the service that long since I did thee,\n","\tWhen I bestrid thee in the wars and took\n","\tDeep scars to save thy life; even for the blood\n","\tThat then I lost for thee, now grant me justice. She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,\n","\tThat hath abused and dishonour'd me,\n","\tEven in the strength and height of injury! Discover how, and thou shalt find me just. This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,\n","\tWhile she with harlots feasted in my house. No, my good lord: myself, he, and my sister\n","\tTo-day did dine together. My liege, I am advised what I say:\n","\tNeither disturb'd with the effect of wine,\n","\tNor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,\n","\tAlbeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:\n","\tThat goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,\n","\tCould witness it, for he was with me then;\n","\tWho parted with me to go fetch a chain,\n","\tPromising to bring it to the Porpentine,\n","\tWhere Balthazar and I did dine together. Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,\n","\tI went to seek him: in the street I met him,\n","\tAnd in his company that gentleman. There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down\n","\tThat I this day of him receiv'd the chain,\n","\tWhich, God he knows, I saw not; for the which\n","\tHe did arrest me with an officer. I did obey, and sent my peasant home\n","\tFor certain ducats: he with none return'd. By the way we met\n","\tMy wife, her sister, and a rabble more\n","\tOf vile confederates: along with them\n","\tThey brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,\n","\tA mere anatomy, a mountebank,\n","\tA threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,\n","\tA needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,\n","\tA living-dead man. This pernicious slave,\n","\tForsooth, took on him as a conjurer,\n","\tAnd, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,\n","\tAnd with no face, as 'twere, out-facing me,\n","\tCries out, I was possess'd. Then, altogether\n","\tThey fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,\n","\tAnd in a dark and dankish vault at home\n","\tThere left me and my man, both bound together;\n","\tTill, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,\n","\tI gain'd my freedom, and immediately\n","\tRan hither to your Grace; whom I beseech\n","\tTo give me ample satisfaction\n","\tFor these deep shames and great indignities. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,\n","\tThat he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out. He had, my lord; and when he ran in here,\n","\tThese people saw the chain about his neck. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine\n","\tHeard you confess you had the chain of him\n","\tAfter you first forswore it on the mart;\n","\tAnd thereupon I drew my sword on you;\n","\tAnd then you fled into this abbey here,\n","\tFrom whence, I think, you are come by miracle. I never came within these abbey walls;\n","\tNor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;\n","\tI never saw the chain, so help me heaven! If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;\n","\tIf he were mad, he would not plead so coldly;\n","\tYou say he din'd at home; the goldsmith here\n","\tDenies that saying. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine. He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace. Why, this is strange. Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:\n","\tHaply I see a friend will save my life,\n","\tAnd pay the sum that may deliver me. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir;\n","\tBut he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:\n","\tNow am I Dromio and his man, unbound. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;\n","\tFor lately we were bound, as you are now. grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last,\n","\tAnd careful hours, with Time's deformed hand,\n","\tHave written strange defeatures in my face:\n","\tBut tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice? No, trust me, sir, not I.\n","\n","\n","\n","\tI am sure thou dost. Ay, sir; but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him. O, time's extremity,\n","\tHast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue\n","\tIn seven short years, that here my only son\n","\tKnows not my feeble key of untun'd cares? Though now this grained face of mine be hid\n","\tIn sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,\n","\tAnd all the conduits of my blood froze up,\n","\tYet hath my night of life some memory,\n","\tMy wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,\n","\tMy dull deaf ears a little use to hear:\n","\tAll these old witnesses, I cannot err,\n","\tTell me thou art my son Antipholus. But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,\n","\tThou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,\n","\tThou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years\n","\tHave I been patron to Antipholus,\n","\tDuring which time he ne'er saw Syracusa. Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd. One of these men is Genius to the other;\n","\tAnd so of these: which is the natural man,\n","\tAnd which the spirit? I, sir, am Dromio: command him away. I, sir, am Dromio: pray let me stay. Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,\n","\tAnd gain a husband by his liberty. Speak, old Ægeon, if thou be'st the man\n","\tThat hadst a wife once call'd Æmilia,\n","\tThat bore thee at a burden two fair sons. If I dream not, thou art Æmilia:\n","\tIf thou art she, tell me where is that son\n","\tThat floated with thee on the fatal raft? By men of Epidamnum, he and I,\n","\tAnd the twin Dromio, all were taken up:\n","\tBut by and by rude fishermen of Corinth\n","\tBy force took Dromio and my son from them,\n","\tAnd me they left with those of Epidamnum. What then became of them, I cannot tell;\n","\tI to this fortune that you see me in. Why, here begins his morning story right:\n","\tThese two Antipholus', these two so like,\n","\tAnd these two Dromios, one in semblance,\n","\tBesides her urging of her wrack at sea;\n","\tThese are the parents to these children,\n","\tWhich accidentally are met together. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse. Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,—\n","\n","\n","\n","\tAnd I with him. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,\n","\tDuke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle. I, gentle mistress. And so do I; yet did she call me so;\n","\tAnd this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,\n","\tDid call me brother. What I told you then,\n","\tI hope I shall have leisure to make good,\n","\tIf this be not a dream I see and hear. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me. I think it be, sir; I deny it not. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me. I think I did, sir; I deny it not. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,\n","\tBy Dromio; but I think he brought it not. No, none by me. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,\n","\tAnd Dromio, my man, did bring them me. I see we still did meet each other's man,\n","\tAnd I was ta'en for him, and he for me,\n","\tAnd thereupon these errors are arose. Sir, I must have that diamond from you. There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer. Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains\n","\tTo go with us into the abbey here,\n","\tAnd hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;\n","\tAnd all that are assembled in this place,\n","\tThat by this sympathized one day's error\n","\tHave suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,\n","\tAnd we shall make full satisfaction. Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail\n","\tOf you, my sons; and, till this present hour\n","\tMy heavy burdens ne'er delivered. The duke, my husband, and my children both,\n","\tAnd you the calendars of their nativity,\n","\tGo to a gossip's feast, and joy with me:\n","\tAfter so long grief such festivity! Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd? Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur. I am your master, Dromio:\n","\tCome, go with us; we'll look to that anon:\n","\tEmbrace thy brother there; rejoice with him. There is a fat friend at your master's house,\n","\tThat kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:\n","\tShe now shall be my sister, not my wife. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:\n","\tI see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth. Not I, sir; you are my elder. Nay, then, thus:\n","\tWe came into the world like brother and brother;\n","\tAnd now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.\n","\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","meteor_scores, bert_scores, rouge_scores = evaluate_summaries(generated_summary, reference_summary)\n","\n","# Print evaluation scores\n","print(\"METEOR scores:\")\n","for method, score in meteor_scores.items():\n","    print(f\"{method}: {score}\")\n","print()\n","\n","print(\"BERT scores:\")\n","for method, score in bert_scores.items():\n","    print(f\"{method}: {score}\")\n","print()\n","\n","print(\"ROUGE scores:\")\n","for method, score in rouge_scores.items():\n","    print(f\"{method}: {score}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bPftMunq2qpl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713423735920,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17776,"user":{"displayName":"Jahnavi Mullapudi","userId":"10597368730793325302"}},"outputId":"c3d40320-0f49-4134-f3a4-bc6b140f86b1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-large and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']\n","You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["METEOR scores:\n","Generated: 0.14132272025900494\n","\n","BERT scores:\n","Generated: 0.7870688438415527\n","\n","ROUGE scores:\n","Generated: {'rouge-1': {'r': 0.5239852398523985, 'p': 0.04588045234248788, 'f': 0.08437314171609318}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.13008130081300814, 'p': 0.007070260715863898, 'f': 0.013411566499084211}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.5055350553505535, 'p': 0.04426494345718902, 'f': 0.08140225639226668}}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#9\n","#TF-IDF\n","generated_summary=\"\"\"Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
